#    rewritten` is absolute: a document the kernel ACCEPTS and hands back with
#    different bytes is data loss and there is no baseline for it.
#    `corpus_round_trip` is a ratchet against corpus/round-trip.expected: a file
#    recorded as round-tripping that stops doing so fails; a file that starts
#    doing so does not, because the grammar is still being extended.  Rebless
