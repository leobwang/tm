#    harness makes since the owner's D6 (a parent is read off its line, so a week
#    file naming month outcomes cannot load alone; README "Stage 4 final", step
#    3).  A file of a refused plan scores `reject`.  This is the only check that covers the split of bytes into
#    lines and back, which happens outside the kernel (README gap 6), and the
#    JSON escaping on both sides of the FFI.
#
#    Two assertions, and they are different in kind.  `no_file_is_silently_
#    rewritten` is absolute: a document the kernel ACCEPTS and hands back with
#    different bytes is data loss and there is no baseline for it.
#    `corpus_round_trip` is a ratchet against corpus/round-trip.expected: a file
#    recorded as round-tripping that stops doing so fails; a file that starts
#    doing so does not, because the grammar is still being extended.  Rebless

# 7. The outstanding goals of stages 3-6 elaborate.  TmKernel/Goals.lean states

#    definitions, so a goal nobody can state is visible now rather than in
#    stage 6.  `sorry` warnings are the point here; ERRORS are not, and that is
#    what this checks.
#
#    The count is a BURN-DOWN, not a score.  A stage that discharges a goal
#    moves the theorem into its real module and deletes it from Goals.lean, and
#    the number drops.  It rises only when a new debt is admitted.
#
#    Nothing imports Goals.lean, so its `sorry`s cannot reach a proved theorem;
#    check 3 above is what enforces that -- a sorryAx there means it leaked.
